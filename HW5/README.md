# HW5 - Finding a House in ByteLand üè°

## Problem Statement

ByteLand has been redesigned into a grid of R √ó C cells, where ADA, a little girl, wants to reach her home at the bottom-right cell as fast as possible. However, there are various types of terrain that affect movement:

- Empty cells (1) allow movement in 1 second.
- Muddy cells (2-5) take 2 to 5 seconds to traverse.
- Rocky cells (0) cannot be traversed.
- Teleportation cells (-1) allow instant movement to specific cells.
- Spiky cells (-2) can only be crossed a limited number of times (H).

The goal is to compute the minimum time required for ADA to reach each cell from the starting position (1,1), or -1 if the cell is unreachable.

## Input Format

The input consists of multiple test instances:

- The first line contains an integer T, the number of test cases.
- For each test case, The first line contains three integers:
- - R ‚Üí Number of rows.
- - C ‚Üí Number of columns.
- - H ‚Üí Maximum number of spiky cells ADA can walk over.
- The next R lines each contain C integers, representing the grid:
- - 1 ‚Üí Empty cell (1-second movement).
- - 0 ‚Üí Rocky cell (impassable).
- - 2-5 ‚Üí Muddy cell (movement takes grid[i][j] seconds).
- - 1 ‚Üí Teleportation cell.
- - 2 ‚Üí Spiky cell (can only be crossed H times).

## Output Format

For each test case, print an R √ó C matrix, where result[i][j] represents the minimum time to reach cell (i, j) from (1,1).

- If a cell cannot be reached, print -1.

## Constraints

1. 1 ‚â§ R, C ‚â§ 1000
2. 0 ‚â§ H ‚â§ 10
3. The total number of cells across all instances is at most 4 √ó 10‚Å∂
4. Time Limit: 3 seconds (C/C++), 5 seconds (Python)

## Approach & Solution

This problem is solved using Dijkstra‚Äôs Algorithm with a priority queue (heapq) to handle weighted grid traversal efficiently.

- ‚úÖ Initialize a 3D distance matrix result[r][c][spiky_count] to store the minimum time for each cell, keeping track of the number of spiky cells stepped on.
- ‚úÖ Use a priority queue (heapq) to process the shortest paths first (Dijkstra's strategy).
- ‚úÖ Handle teleportation cells efficiently by precomputing the leftmost/rightmost/topmost/bottommost teleport destinations.
- ‚úÖ Ensure spiky cell constraints by maintaining a count of spiky steps used.
- ‚úÖ Process muddy cells with their specific weight (2-5).
