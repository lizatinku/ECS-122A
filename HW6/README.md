# HW6 - Radio Towers Yet Again üì°

## Problem Statement

In ByteLand, there are n cities positioned along the x-axis at coordinates A‚ÇÅ, A‚ÇÇ, ..., A‚Çô. A telecom company wants to place radio towers, each with a fixed coverage radius d, at specific possible locations B‚ÇÅ, B‚ÇÇ, ..., B‚Çò. Each tower at position y covers a city at position x if |x - y| ‚â§ d.
The goal is to find, for each k (1 ‚â§ k ‚â§ m), how many ways we can place exactly k towers such that:
- Every city is covered by exactly one tower.
- Towers are placed only at the provided candidate locations.
- No city is covered by more than one tower.


## Input Format

Each test case consists of:
- An integer C: number of test instances.
- For each test instance:
  - Line 1: Three integers n, m, d ‚Äî number of cities, number of potential tower locations, and coverage radius.
  - Line 2: n sorted integers: A‚ÇÅ, A‚ÇÇ, ..., A‚Çô ‚Äî positions of cities.
  - Line 3: m sorted integers: B‚ÇÅ, B‚ÇÇ, ..., B‚Çò ‚Äî potential tower positions.


## Output Format
- For each test instance, print a line of m space-separated integers.
- The k-th integer (1-indexed) should represent the number of valid tower placements using exactly k towers such that each city is covered uniquely by a tower.
- Since answers may be large, return each modulo 10‚Åπ + 7.

```

### Output

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 486784380 0 0 ...
```

## Constraints
1. 1 ‚â§ n ‚â§ 10‚Åµ, 1 ‚â§ m ‚â§ 1200
2. 0 ‚â§ A·µ¢, B‚±º ‚â§ 10‚Åπ
3. Arrays A and B are strictly increasing.
4. Up to 10 test instances per file.
5. Total cities across test cases ‚â§ 2 √ó 10‚Åµ

## Approach & Solution
My solution uses a combination of:

- ‚úÖBinary Search: To quickly identify ranges of cities that can be covered by a tower.
- ‚úÖDynamic Programming (DP): A 2D DP table is maintained where dp[i][k] represents the number of ways to place k towers such that the rightmost tower is at B[i] and all cities left of B[i] are uniquely covered.
- ‚úÖPrefix Sums: For efficient computation of range sums in the DP state transitions.
- ‚úÖModular Arithmetic: All calculations are performed under modulo 10‚Åπ + 7 using a custom class to avoid overflow.
